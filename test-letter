I am writing to notify you of my formal resignation from BNP Paribas as of today. Thank you for all of the opportunities presented to me.

I believe you are aware I have raised my concerns over the last 3 years around the use of my skills and interests in .Net and Solution Architecture.
Unfortunately, I felt that due to the ongoing APS Oversight commitments I was drifting further away from my personal development plans and career progression.

I really appreciate your acknowledgement and efforts in helping me free up my time to focus on my core skills.
The new opportunity presented to me around Solution Architecture and Microsoft Cloud/.Net, I believe will be really exciting for me and I look forward to it.

This has been a very difficult decision for me.
BNP Paribas, my colleagues, my team and the work environment have a special place in my heart.
I can only wish I walk into a similar welcoming environment in my new role.

Please let me know what the next steps are and if you require any further information from me.
